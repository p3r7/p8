# p8

Compatibility layer to run [_PICO-8_](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) scripts on the [_monome norns_](https://monome.org/docs/norns/).

This is not suitable for running full-fledged carts (with sprites, sound...), targeting instead [_tweetcarts_](https://twitter.com/hashtag/tweetcart?lang=en) (code fitting in a tweet).


## Why?

Both platform share similar goals: build a community around sharing small apps written in Lua.

_PICO-8_ is centered around games, _norns_ around music-making apps.

The _PICO-8_ community provided some pretty crazy examples of what can be done with basic functions and I thought that one community could benefit from the efforts of the other.

The aim is not to have it embedded systematically in a _norns_ app but instead to quickly steal animation ideas from _tweetcart_ and see how they get rendered on the _norns_ display.


## How?

By defining PICO-8 API functions from norns-compatible Lua code ([code](./lib/p8.lua)).

To compare them:
- [_PICO-8_ API reference](https://pico-8.fandom.com/wiki/APIReference), [manual](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php?page=manual) (more up to date)
- [_norns_ API reference](https://monome.org/docs/norns/api/) (look especially at the [screen](https://monome.org/docs/norns/api/classes/screen.html) API)

Their display APIs are pretty close to one another.

On the contrary, _PICO-8's_ trigonometric functions behave quite differently from the standard Lua `math` lib.

## Usage

#### General

Most _PICO-8_ _tweetcarts_ are not defined using the [game loop](https://pico-8.fandom.com/wiki/GameLoop) but a combination of `goto` and `flip` instead.

To be executed on _norns_, they need to be slightly adapted:

 - the label / `goto` block needs to be moved to a function (typically `redraw`)
 - this function needs to be called from a `metro` object

See the [Examples](#examples) for concrete use-cases.


#### print

_PICO-8's_ `print` allows printing on the screen.

_norns_ is not happy with having the standard `print` function redefined.

That's why _PICO-8's_ version got renamed `p8print`.


#### Special _PICO-8_ Lua syntax

_PICO-8's_ Lua differs a bit from standard Lua.

It notably provides additional constructs such as a short form if/else ternary syntax and compound assignment operators (e.g. `+=`). These instructions should be converted for _norns_ to interpret them.

Refer to [this page](https://gist.github.com/josefnpat/bfe4aaa5bbb44f572cd0) for more detailed porting instructions.

```lua
-- valid PICO-8 Lua
t += 1
if (not b) then i=1 j=2 end
j != 0

-- equivalent Lua
t = t + 1
if (not b) then i=1 else j=2 end
j ~= 0
```

There is also the `@<address>` shorthand for `peek` that would need to be converted to an explicit `peek` call.


## Completeness

Not all of [_PICO-8_ APIs](https://pico-8.fandom.com/wiki/APIReference) will get implemented.

The following are not yet here but are the next one on the list:
- `fillp` (patterned fill)
- `tline` (textured line)
- map and table APIs

These are interesting but seem difficult to implement fully with current _norns_ APIs:
- `pget`
- `clip`
- `camera`

These might get implemented in a very loose way:
- `fset` / `fget`
- sprite sheet fns: `sset` / `sget`, `spr`, `sspr`

Current implementation of `print` (`p8print`) does not handle `\n` and screen scroll on end of framebuffer.

Current implementation of `peek` and `poke` only support interacting with the current color and current text cursor position.

Current implementation of `pal` doesn't honor the `p` parameter.


## Implementation details

Table manipulation API functions (`foreach`, `all`, `add`, `del`) stolen from the [picolove](https://github.com/picolove/picolove) project.
